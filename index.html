	<h3>In 2012 Mark Zuckerberg commented, "The biggest mistake we made as a company was betting too much on HTML as opposed to native".[11] Using HTML5 for Facebook's mobile version resulted in an unstable application that retrieved data slowly.[12][13] He promised Facebook would soon deliver a better mobile experience.</h3>

<h3>Inside Facebook, Jordan Walke found a way to generate UI elements for iOS from a background JavaScript thread.[14][circular reference] They decided to organize an internal Hackathon to perfect this prototype in order to be able to build native apps with this technology.[15]</h3>

<h3>After months of development, Facebook released the first version for the React JavaScript Configuration in 2015. During a technical talk,[16] Christopher Chedeau explained that Facebook was already using React Native in production for their Group App and their Ads Manager App.[17] </h3>
